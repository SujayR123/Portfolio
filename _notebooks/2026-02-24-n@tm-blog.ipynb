    "The software development life cycle starts with planning. You first think of ideas and decide what you want to build with your team. After that, you begin coding. You can use AI tools to help you, but it is important to write some of the code yourself so you understand how it works. If your project needs to save information, you can add a database to store data. Once the project works, you should clean up the design by removing extra or unnecessary parts. Then, you test the project by letting other people use it and give feedback. Using that feedback helps you improve your project and make it better.\n",

    "Night at the Museum showed how this process leads to real results. The event was full of student projects that were creative and interactive. Many projects were games or tools that taught people something new. Being able to try the projects made the event more interesting and fun. It felt more like a technology showcase than a normal school assignment. Seeing what others created showed how computer science can be used to build things that people can actually use and enjoy. It made clear that CS is not just about grades, but about making ideas come to life."
